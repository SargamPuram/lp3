1. Installation of MetaMask and Studying Gas Usage
Install MetaMask browser extension from official website or Chrome Web Store.

Create or import an Ethereum wallet account in MetaMask.

Connect MetaMask to an Ethereum test network such as Goerli or Sepolia.

Deploy a simple smart contract (such as your BankAccount contract) in Remix IDE.

Interact with the contract functions (send transactions like deposit, withdraw).

Observe the gas used and transaction fees reported in Remix and MetaMask.

Perform multiple transactions with different data and ETH amounts; note effects on gas cost.

Document average gas cost and transaction fees; explain what impacts gas in Ethereum.

2. Create Your Own Wallet Using MetaMask for Crypto Transactions
Open MetaMask and select "Create a Wallet".

Securely record and back up your 12 or 24 word seed phrase offline.

Add ETH testnet tokens via faucets to your wallet.

Send and receive test ETH to/from other wallets.

Explore wallet address, balances, and transaction history.

Use MetaMask's interface for sending ETH and interacting with deployed contracts.

Optionally, connect MetaMask with DApps or Remix for deeper blockchain development.
