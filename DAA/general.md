1. Huffman Coding (Data Compression)
Application:

Widely used in file compression formats like ZIP, GZIP, and compression on multimedia files like JPEG, MP3.

Efficient text compression reducing storage and transmission cost.

Used in network data transmission to reduce bandwidth usage.

2. Fractional Knapsack (Greedy Optimization)
Application:

Resource allocation where partial usage allowed, e.g., filling a cargo with divisible resources like fuel, bulk goods.

Bandwidth allocation in networks where fractional bandwidth slices can be assigned.

Portfolio selection where fractional investments are possible to maximize returns.

3. 0-1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming Optimization)
Application:

Packaging problems where items must be taken whole, e.g., cargo loading, truck loading with constraints.

Project selection with budget constraints to maximize profit or ROI.

Memory allocation in embedded systems where memory blocks must be assigned completely.

4. 8-Queens Problem (Backtracking Search & Constraint Satisfaction)
Application:

Puzzle solving and AI problem solving as a benchmark for backtracking algorithms.

General constraint satisfaction problems like scheduling, layout management.

Hardware testing and fault diagnosis via placement algorithms.

Used in parallel computing and distributed systems for task allocation and resource distribution respecting constraints.
